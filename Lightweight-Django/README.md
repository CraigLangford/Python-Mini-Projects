# Lightweight Django
This project follows the examples in the book Lightweight Django (can be purchased [here](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032502.do)). It focuses on decoupling Django to remove components that aren't needed for smaller projects, coupling Django with javascript (Backbone.js in this case) to create interactive front ends as well as build single page applications! Finally a scrum board is created with realtime interactions demonstrating that Django is capable of creating such applications. As this project follows the book there aren't any tests used (shame).
